<h1 align="center">Welcome to DjaVue IPTV</h1>

> DjaVue IPTV is a Django + Vue webapp to view the television channels on the web. Custom channels can be added, m3u files/links can be parsed and channels can be added from there and added channels can be deleted. m3u files are parsed using [m3u_parser](https://github.com/pawanpaudel93/m3u_parser). Channels can be added to favourites and also removed from favourites. Only registered users can favourite/unfavourite and add/remove channels.
